`OSMnx <https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ is a Python package to work with street networks and other spatial data from OpenStreetMap: retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize street networks as well as other infrastructure types, points of interest, building footprints, speed/travel time, elevation, and more.

Credits to `Geoff Boeing <https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples>`_ - his repo contains usage examples and feature demonstrations on how to use OSMNX:
